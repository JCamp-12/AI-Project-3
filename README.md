# CSV Analysis Tool

## Overview

The CSV Analysis Tool is a Streamlit-based web application designed to assist with the analysis, cleaning, and exploration of CSV datasets. The tool guides users through a step-by-step process to upload a CSV file, inspect the data, clean missing values, and leverage a `query_agent` function to interactively train models and generate data-driven suggestions.

## Features

1. **Upload and Inspect Data**: Easily upload a CSV file and view the first five rows of the dataset.
2. **Identify and Handle Missing Values**: Automatically detect missing values in the dataset and trigger suggestions for cleaning.
3. **Interactive Query Agent**: Utilize the `query_agent` function to process the data, train models, and receive suggestions for improving data quality and analysis.

## Installation

To get started with the CSV Analysis Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/csv-analysis-tool.git
   cd csv-analysis-tool
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Streamlit application by running:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Step 1: Upload CSV**:
   - Start by uploading your CSV file through the provided file uploader in the web interface.
   - Once uploaded, the first five rows of the dataset will be displayed.

2. **Step 2: Analyze Missing Values**:
   - The tool will automatically identify any missing values in the dataset.
   - Users can view the count of missing values and decide how to address them.

3. **Step 3: Query Agent**:
   - Enter a query in the text area to instruct the `query_agent` on how to process the data.
   - The `query_agent` can be used for various purposes such as:
     - Filling in missing values.
     - Training machine learning models.
     - Generating insights or suggestions based on the data.
   - The results of the query will be displayed, including both the input query and the generated response.

## What is `query_agent`?

The `query_agent` function is a core component of the CSV Analysis Tool. It acts as an interactive agent that processes data and queries to provide tailored suggestions and actions. The function takes the uploaded dataset and a user-defined query, and performs operations such as:

- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically filling in missing values or correcting inconsistencies in the data.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models on the provided dataset based on the query parameters.
- **Insight Generation**: Offering insights, trends, or suggestions on how to better analyze or clean the data.

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how the `query_agent` function might be structured:

```python
def query_agent(data, query):
    """
    Processes the dataset based on the provided query.

    Args:
        data: The uploaded CSV file or DataFrame.
        query: A string containing the user's query or instructions.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the input query and the generated response.
    """
    # Example logic to process data based on the query
    response = {
        "input": query,
        "output": "Processed data or suggestions based on the query."
    }
    return response
```

## Example Queries

Here are some example queries you might use with `query_agent`:

- "Fill missing values using the mean of the column."
- "Train a linear regression model to predict sales."
- "Suggest a data cleaning strategy for outliers."

## Future Improvements

This tool is designed to be extensible. Potential enhancements include:

- **Customizable Cleaning Steps**: Allowing users to choose from multiple data cleaning strategies.
- **Model Evaluation**: Providing metrics and visualizations to evaluate model performance.
- **Advanced Querying**: Expanding the capabilities of the `query_agent` to handle more complex data transformations and analyses.
